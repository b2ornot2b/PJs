PJS
===

kinda like pyjamas...

but shorter. quicker. cleaner. more convenient. Oh, and, *easier*. Takes care
of error handling, so you don't get cryptic error messages that originate from
javascript's lazyness regarding undefined variables.

Things you can't do *(yet)*:

- python magic:

  - __add__
  - __sub__
  - __mul__

These are planned, but currently descisions have to be made regarding the
performance losses associated with these magic functions.

Things you can do:

- just about everything else

if you find a bug or something you don't like, feel free to file a ticket on
github, or *even better*, fork the repo, fix your problem, and then pull
request. We love pull requests.

Ok, so this project is starting out. And so none of it is implemented yet. But
I'm working on it ;)

To keep in mind:

- scoping (globals?)
- module importing...reload...sys.modules...
